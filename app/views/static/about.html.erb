    <h3 class="question">What is Blitz Tactics?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      A chess tactics trainer that emphasizes learning tactical patterns,
      rather than just testing your ability to solve puzzles. Hopefully
      in a way that's fun for you.
    </p>


    <h3 class="question">How does it work?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      Each level is a set of 15-20 puzzles. You unlock the next level when
      you can solve each puzzle quickly and without making any mistakes. The puzzles
      in each level cycle indefinitely, so take as long as you need to learn them.
    </p>


    <h3 class="question">How will this make me better at chess?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      Improvement at chess involves (1) learning to recognize what to do in
      specific positions and (2) having FUN while learning. Through repetition,
      you learn patterns. Pattern recognition makes a master. Fun keeps you motivated.
    </p>


    <h3 class="question">What's with the timer on the right of the board?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      It times how you you take to make it through every puzzle in a level. As
      you continue playing each level, you'll naturally become faster as you
      learn the solutions to the puzzles. You can use it to measure your progress.
